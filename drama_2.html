	On September 9, a source from Lee Sung Kyung’s agency YG Entertainment stated to MyDaily, “Lee Sung Kyung <br>
	has received an offer for ‘Romantic Doctor Kim’ season two and is positively looking over it.” A source <br>
	from SBS also relayed the same statement. Actress Lee Sung Kyung will reportedly be leading the second <br>
	season of SBS’s “Romantic Doctor Kim”! Reports emerged on September 9 that Lee Sung Kyung will most likely<br> 
	be working with Han Suk Kyu and Ahn Hyo Seop. Han Suk Kyu is in talks to make a return after the first <br>
	season while Ahn Hyo Seop was reported to be in talks to join the drama back in June. Lee Sung Kyung is<br>
	set to take on the role of Cha Eun Jae, who is a second year fellow in the cardiosurgery department. <br>
	From a young age, she was often called a genius and was on an elite path with praise and expectations <br>
	from those around her. Although everything seemed easy and clear in her textbooks, she freezes once she<br> 
	steps into the operating room but she undergoes changes under the watchful eye of her mentor played by<br>
	Han Suk Kyu. “Romantic Doctor Kim” was a bit hit when it aired from 2016 to 2017, telling the real<br> 
	stories of medical professionals and connecting with viewers. If she agrees to play the role, this<br>
	will be Lee Sung Kyung’s first medical drama in three years since she appeared in the 2016 drama <br>
	“Doctors.” The second season of “Romantic Doctor Kim” is set to premiere in December.
