	Prior to airing its last episode, SBS’s Friday-Saturday drama “Doctor John” delivered the three lead actors’ thoughts<br> 
	and feelings on finally concluding the drama! Since its premiere, “Doctor John” showed nothing but growth and success. <br>
	The drama premiered to solid ratings on July 19, and it soon took over the No. 1 spot in its time slot, where it remained<br> 
	until its final episode on September 7. Regarding the end of the drama, Ji Sung said, “It’s bittersweet that the grand <br>
	journey of ‘Doctor John,’ which lasted about six months, has wrapped up. I think the staff members of ‘Doctor John’<br> 
	with whom I’ve become close, the actors I worked with, and the character Cha Yo Han will remain in my heart for a long time.”<br>
	The actor continued, “The things I realized, the things that felt worthwhile, and the happy memories that I gained during<br> 
	filming and while living as the anesthesiologist Yo Han will pop up in my mind from time to time. I thank the director,<br>
	staff members, all of the actors, and viewers who gifted me with these fond memories.” Lee Se Young, who starred as the <br>
	intelligent anesthesiology resident Kang Si Young, also shared her thoughts. The actress stated, “During the past six<br> 
	months that I’ve spent with ‘Doctor John,’ I cried a lot, but more importantly, I got to laugh a lot.” She continued, <br>
	“I thank the viewers who encouraged and showed support for Si Young as she overcame a deep pain and grew. I would also<br>
	like to deliver my sincere gratitude to all the ‘Doctor John’ family members who stayed by Si Young’s side.”<br>

	Lee Kyu Hyung, who played the charismatic prosecutor Son Seok Ki, commented, “I was glad to be able to greet<br>
	viewers through a great project like ‘Doctor John.’ It was an exciting experience to work with director Jo Soo<br> 
	Won and Ji Sung. I would like to thank and tell every actor and staff member of the drama that they did well.<br> 
	I sincerely thank all the viewers who loved ‘Doctor John’ until now.”<br>

	Supporting actors Hwang Hee, Kim Hye Eun, Shin Dong Mi, Oh Seung Hyun, Kim Young Hoon, Kwon Ha Woon, and Oh <br>
	Hyun Joong also expressed their feelings of gratitude towards the staff and viewers.<br>
	

	Lastly, the production team said, “We thank all actors including Ji Sung, Lee Se Young, and Lee Kyu Hyung, <br>
	who showed their devoted passion as best as they could for ‘Doctor John,’ every staff member who participated<br> 
	in filming despite how tired and exhausting it was, and viewers who showed lots of support.”</div>
