	“Legend of the Phoenix” follows Ye Ningzhi (He Hong Shan), a sprightly circus performer who falls for Wei <br>
	Guang (Jeremy Tsui), a strategist for the royal palace. She gets embroiled in the power struggle between<br> 
	Emperor Pang Tong (Cui Peng) and Grand Princess Pang Zhen (Liu Min). Ye Ningzhi later enters the palace,<br> 
	resolving to protect the citizens of Eastern Liang. “Legend of the Phoenix” stands out from other Chinese<br> 
	costume dramas in that it diverges from the typical trajectory of palace stories. Here are three ways that <br>
	it does just that! The focus on politics over the inner court Unlike other palace dramas, this series does<br> 
	not have a strong focus on the harem. Rather, “Legend of the Phoenix” has chosen to center its plot on the <br>
	weak dynasty, inadequate ruler, and the various complications that put the nation in danger. This distinction<br> 
	brings in a good opportunity for the protagonist Ningzhi to show character development. She starts off as a<br> 
	lively young girl whose main worry comes from chasing after Wei Guang to becoming a female official and<br> 
	concubine who puts the safety of the nation above all else. This comes as a surprising direction for the<br> 
	storyline, especially since the beginning of the series focuses on Ningzhi and Wei Guang’s romance. In<br> 
	fact, it focuses on it so strongly that a turn for the angsty and typical fanfare of betrayals and harem<br> 
	drama almost seems a given. However, because the drama strays from this, Ningzhi’s maturation becomes<br> 
	much more meaningful. While she is tied down to her fate as a concubine, she accepts the weight of <br>
	responsibility she has to undertake as someone from the royal family. Thus, the drama goes beyond <br>
	the common portrayal of a woman who vies for power and shifts the focal point to what a woman of <br>
	power can do for the weak and powerless.
